# What is PyXE?
PyXE is a compile-x86 emulation based programming language.

# How it works?
 1. PyXE code file recompiles into an x86 Assembler (SASM)
 2. SASM compiles into HEX code.
 3. PyXE x86 Emulator emulate HEX Assembler.

# Why this is a just SASM Compiler?
PyXE *isn't a SASM Compiler.* It has own commands.
